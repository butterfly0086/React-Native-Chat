## Changing MessageInput layout

We provide the `MessageInput` container out of the box in a fixed configuration with many customizable features. Similar to other components it accesses most customizations via context, specially the `MessageInputContext` which is instantiated in `Channel`. You can also pass the same props as the context provides directly to the `MessageInput` component to override the context values.

```tsx
<Channel
  channel={channel}
  // Custom component for input
  Input={() => <View style={{ height: 40, backgroundColor: 'red' }} />}
  keyboardVerticalOffset={headerHeight}
  Message={CustomMessageComponent}
>
  <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <MessageList />
    <MessageInput />
  </View>
</Channel>
```

The code above would render the red `View` and not `null` as the props take precedence over the context value.

You can modify `MessageInput` in a large variety of ways. The type definitions for the props give clear insight into all of the options. You can replace the `Input` wholesale, as above, or create you own `MessageInput` component using the provided hooks to access context.

  <tr>
    <td align='center'>Replace SendButton</td>
    <td align='center'>hasFilePicker & hasImagePicker - false</td>
    <td align='center'>numberOfLines={2}</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**NOTE:** The `additionalTextInputProps` prop of both `Channel` and `MessageInput` is passed the the internal [`TextInput`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/textinput) component from `react-native`. If you want to change the `TextInput` component props directly this can be done using this prop.

## Disable autocomplete feature on input (mentions and commands)

The auto-complete trigger settings by default include `/`, `@`, and `:` for slash commands, mentions, and emojis respectively. These triggers are created by the exported function `ACITriggerSettings`, which takes `ACITriggerSettingsParams` and returns `TriggerSettings`. You can override this function to remove some or all of the trigger settings via the `autoCompleteTriggerSettings` prop on `Channel`. If you remove the slash commands it is suggested you also remove the commands button using the prop on `Channel` `hasCommands`. You can remove all of the commands by returning an empty object from the function given to `autoCompleteTriggerSettings`.

```tsx
<Channel
  autoCompleteTriggerSettings={() => ({})}
  channel={channel}
  hasCommands={false}
  keyboardVerticalOffset={headerHeight}
  thread={thread}
>
```
